# EconoMimic

This is an agent-based model of a simple economy.
Designed as a solo project to satisfy @forloopcowboy's curiosity about how economies work,
this project intends to be a simulator and a visualizer for a simple economy,
but also a tool for learning about the economy and the agents that make it up.

### How does it work?

The economy is made up of agents, each of which has a few simple rules for how they behave.
It's intended to first and foremost simplify the human lifecycle, and 
through this modeling of human behaviour and needs, build an economy around it.
